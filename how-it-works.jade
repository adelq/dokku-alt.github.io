                | Dokku Alt is most suitable to deploy in-house low-cost multi-site
                | deployment environments which are secure and easy to manage. If
                | you have ever used Apache with VirtualHosts then Dokku Alt is a
                | modern replacament for this technology.

            p
                | Built on top of Docker, Dokku Alt is a manager for your websites,
                | running alongside any imaginable framework, language or webserver.

                    p
                        | Once Dokku-Alt is deployed, you can access it through ssh like this:

                        code.atk-box
                            | $ ssh dokku@my.node.org mariadb:create myapp newdb

                    p
                        | The above command will create new database for an
                        | application and automatically link with it.

                    p
                        | Create a new "git" repository and deploy it directly
                        | inside a new container like this:

                        code.atk-box
                            | $ git add remote deploy dokku@my.dokku-alt.com:myapp
                            br
                            | $ git push deploy master

                    p
                        | Docker will set up a new container for your application,
                        | install necessary dependencies and finally link your
                        | application with a domain of your choice.

            h3 Adding Database or Volume support
            p
                | If your application relies on database or stores files
                | locally, dokku can easily set this up for you.

            code.atk-box
                | $ dokku volume:create vol1 /data/volume1
                br
                | $ dokku volume:link myapp1 vol1
                br
                | $ dokku volume:link myapp2 vol1

            code.atk-box
                | $ dokku mariadb:create mydb
                br
                | $ dokku mariadb:link myapp1 mydb
                br
                | $ dokku mariadb:link myapp2 mydb
